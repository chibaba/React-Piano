### This application is a  virtual Piano keyboard with a list of instruments

### We will use a third-party API to generate musical notes and the browser built-

###  in AudioContext API to get access to a userâ€™s sound hardware. The real computer

### keyboard will be connected to a virtual one, so that when a user presses the button

###  on their keyboard they will hear a musical note. And, of course, we will create a list

###  of instruments to select different sounds for our keyboard.
